Problem Statement: There is a new barn with N stalls and C cows. The stalls are located on a straight line at positions x1,….,xN (0 <= xi <= 1,000,000,000). We want to assign the cows to the stalls, such that the minimum distance between any two of them is as large as possible. What is the largest minimum distance?

Examples:

Input: No of stalls = 5 
       Array: {1,2,8,4,9}
       And number of cows: 3

Output: One integer, the largest minimum distance 3
Solution 1: Brute Force

Intuition: 

It’s required that we put all the C cows into our stalls. So for a start, let’s say we set the minimum distance = 1 and put them consecutively. These cows fit perfectly.

This is too close, so let’s increase our minimum distance a bit. Let’s increase the distance further to 2. We can again check that the cows can be accommodated. 

But we want to reduce the possibility of collision/fighting as much as possible, so we keep on increasing the minimum distance. Here is an illustration:

#include <bits/stdc++.h>

using namespace std;
bool isCompatible(vector < int > inp, int dist, int cows) {
  int n = inp.size();
  int k = inp[0];
  cows--;
  for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    if (inp[i] - k >= dist) {
      cows--;
      if (!cows) {
        return true;
      }
      k = inp[i];
    }
  }
  return false;
}
int main() {
  int n = 5, m = 3;
  vector<int> inp {1,2,8,4,9};
  sort(inp.begin(), inp.end());
  int maxD = inp[n - 1] - inp[0];
  int ans = INT_MIN;
  for (int d = 1; d <= maxD; d++) {
    bool possible = isCompatible(inp, d, m);
    if (possible) {
      ans = max(ans, d);
    }
  }
  cout << "The largest minimum distance is " << ans << '\n';
}



solution 2
 #include <bits/stdc++.h>

    using namespace std;
    bool isPossible(int a[], int n, int cows, int minDist) {
      int cntCows = 1;
      int lastPlacedCow = a[0];
      for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        if (a[i] - lastPlacedCow >= minDist) {
          cntCows++;
          lastPlacedCow = a[i];
        }
      }
      if (cntCows >= cows) return true;
      return false;
    }
    int main() {
      int n = 5, cows = 3;
      int a[]={1,2,8,4,9};
      sort(a, a + n);

      int low = 1, high = a[n - 1] - a[0];

      while (low <= high) {
        int mid = (low + high) >> 1;

        if (isPossible(a, n, cows, mid)) {
          low = mid + 1;
        } else {
          high = mid - 1;
        }
      }
      cout << "The largest minimum distance is " << high << endl;

      return 0;
    }
Output: The largest minimum distance is 3

Time Complexity: O(N*log(M)). 

Reason: For binary search in a space of M, O(log(M))  and for each search, we iterate over max N stalls to check. O(N).
