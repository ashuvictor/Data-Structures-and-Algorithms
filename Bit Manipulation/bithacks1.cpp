Check if an integer is even or odd
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
 
int main()
{
    int n = 5;
 
    if (n & 1) {
        cout << n << " is odd";
    }
    else {
        cout << n << " is even";
    }
 
    return 0;
}
Detect if two integers have opposite signs or not
he expression output x ^ y is negative if x and y have opposite signs.
 We know that for a positive number, the leftmost bit is 0, and for a negative number, it is 1. Now for similar sign integers,
 the XOR operator will set the leftmost bit of output as 0, and for opposite sign integers, it will set the leftmost bit as 1.
 #include <iostream>
#include <bitset>
using namespace std;
 
int main()
{
    int x = 4;
    int y = -8;
 
    cout << x << " in binary is " << bitset<32>(x) << endl;
    cout << y << " in binary is " << bitset<32>(y) << endl;
 
    // true if `x` and `y` have opposite signs
    bool isOpposite = ((x ^ y) < 0);
 
    if (isOpposite) {
        cout << x << " and " << y << " have opposite signs";
    }
    else {
        cout << x << " and " << y << " don't have opposite signs";
    }
 
    return 0;
}
 Add 1 to an integer
 The expression -~x will add 1 to an integer x. We know that to get negative of a number, invert its bits and add 1 to it (Remember negative numbers are stored in 2â€™s complement form), i.e.,

-x = ~x + 1;
-~x = x + 1 (by replacing x by ~x)
Swap two numbers without using any third variable
void swap(int &x, int &y)
{
    if (x != y)
    {
        x = x ^ y;
        y = x ^ y;
        x = x ^ y;
    }
}
