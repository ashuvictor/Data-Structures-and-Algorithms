Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value target in an m x n integer matrix matrix. This matrix has the following properties:

Integers in each row are sorted from left to right.
The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.

/*Second 
Given an n x n matrix and a number x, find the position of x in the matrix if it is present in it. Otherwise, print “Not Found”. In the given matrix, every row and column is sorted in increasing order. The designed algorithm should have linear time complexity. 

Example: 

Input: mat[4][4] = { {10, 20, 30, 40},
                      {15, 25, 35, 45},
                      {27, 29, 37, 48},
                      {32, 33, 39, 50}};
              x = 29
Output: Found at (2, 1)
Explanation: Element at (2,1) is 29
